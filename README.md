# üß© Connecting Two Tables in Spring Boot (Employee‚ÄìDepartment)

This project demonstrates how to **connect two MySQL tables** (Employee and Department) using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Data JPA**, and **Hibernate**.  
It showcases **One-to-Many** and **Many-to-One** relationships, as well as performing **JOIN operations** via REST APIs.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Spring Boot application with MySQL integration
- `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToOne` relationship mapping
- REST API to fetch employees along with department details
- Uses JPA and Hibernate for ORM
- Lightweight backend, easy to extend

## üß± Database Structure

### üßç Employee Table
| Column Name   | Type         | Description              |
|----------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Employee_id    | INT (Primary Key) | Unique employee ID      |
| Name           | VARCHAR(50)   | Employee name            |
| Designation    | VARCHAR(50)   | Employee job title       |
| Company_Name   | VARCHAR(50)   | Name of the company      |

### üè¢ Department Table
| Column Name   | Type         | Description                     |
|----------------|---------------|---------------------------------|
| Dept_ID        | INT (Primary Key) | Department ID                |
| Dept_Name      | VARCHAR(50)   | Department name                |
| Location       | VARCHAR(50)   | Department location            |

## üß© Entity Relationship Diagram



- One Employee can belong to multiple Departments.  
- Each Department is linked to one Employee.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot** (v3+)
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **MySQL Database**
- **Hibernate ORM**
- **Maven**
- **Postman** for API testing

## üß† How It Works

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Define Entities
- `Employee.java`
- `Department.java`  
  with `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToOne` mapping.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create Repositories
- `EmployeeRepository.java`
- `DepartmentRepository.java`

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Build REST Controller
- `EmployeeController.java` exposes endpoint `/api/employees/flat-with-department`

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run Application
- Database connection configured in `application.properties`:
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3307/spring_suit?useSSL=false
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=12345
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true



GET http://localhost:8080/api/employees/flat-with-department
